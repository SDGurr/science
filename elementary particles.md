# Elementary Particles

In particle physics, *flavour* or *flavor* refers to the species of an elementary particle. The Standard Model counts six flavors of quarks and six flavors of leptons. They are conventionally parameterized with flavour quantum numbers that are assigned to all subatomic particles. They can also be described by some of the family symmetries proposed for the quark-lepton generations.

> **Quantum Numbers**
>In chemistry and quantum physics, quantum numbers describe values of conserved quantities in the dynamics of a quantum system. In the case of electrons, the quantum numbers can be defined as "the sets of numerical values which give acceptable solutions to the Schrödinger wave equation for the hydrogen atom". In more general cases, quantum numbers correspond to eigenvalues of operators that commute with the Hamiltonian—quantities that can be known with precision at the same time as the system's energy[note 1]—and their corresponding eigenspaces. Together, a specification of all of the quantum numbers of a quantum system fully characterize a basis state of the system, and can in principle be measured together. 

There are six types, known as flavors, of quarks:
- up
- down

- strange
- charm

- bottom
- top.
